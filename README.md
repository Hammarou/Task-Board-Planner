## Description

Greetings! 

- The purpose of this project is to enable the intended user (a company associate/manager handling the employee payroll matrix) to view and manage employee payroll data. The user will be prompted to enter as many employees as they wish (they will be prompted to provide nominal background information about each employee, such as first and last names, and salary). From this, the user will be able to acquire a list of all the employees (along with their information) they have entered; as well as calculate the average employee salary.

## Installation

* Clone repository: `git clone git@github.com:Hammarou/Task-Board-Planner.git`
* Inside terminal cd into cloned repository in local machine `cd Task-Board-Planner`
* Install dependencies: `npm install` 

## Usage

- The purpose of the Task Board Planner is to allow users the ability to create and record project tasks; and assign each task a due date for completion. 

- Tasks are stored locally and will continue across multiple user seesions, unless deleted.

### Task description

Tasks that are saved to the 'To Do' task plate  have a title, due date and description based off of the inputs placed by the user in the modal form. Based of when each task is due, they are color coded:

* White: The task is due at some date in the future of the current date.
* Yellow: The task is due on the same day as the current date.
* Red: The task is overdue.


### Move task

Each task can be moved between the three task plate ('To Do', In Progress' and 'Done') by drag and drop. However, once the task is placed in the 'Done' taskbar it changes color to white and can nolonger be dropped in the 'To Do' task lane.
